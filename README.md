OpenAI Sustainable AI Blog Generator 


This project is a simple Python application that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate informative and engaging blog paragraphs related to Sustainable AI initiatives.


Overview

Sustainable AI involves the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence to minimise environmental impact, promote fairness, and benefit society in the long term. This tool helps researchers and writers quickly generate content on the latest Sustainable AI practices and initiatives worldwide. This project was inspired by my time as a Junior Programs Officer at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland. There I was learning about Sustainable AI initiatives and what ITU stakeholders, partners, and international bodies were doing regarding standards revolving around Sustainable AI.
